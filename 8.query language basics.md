# Search Query Language
 Elastic uses a json style domain specific language which is referred as **Query DSL**
 Let's see few examples

 The datas can be retrieved from elastic REST api using GET, POST. For an GET request, the queries passed as an url parameter.  For a POST request the query will be passed as a JSON body which gives us more power to express. 

 * All the queries start with a word _"query"_
    * Example: 
    ```{
        "query": {}
    }```

 * To match all the records , use *"match_all"* .  This is an equivalent to the SQL query  _Select * from Table_
    * Example: 
    ```{
        "query": {
            "match_all": {}
        }
    }```

 * To specify the size , use *size*. This is equivalent to the SQL query _LIMIT_ or _TOP 10_
    * Example:
    ```{
        "query": {
            "match_all": {},
            "size": "15"
        }
    }```

 * To specify the size range use *from and size* . This is equivalent to the SQL query _BETWEEN 100 and 200_
    * Example: 
    ```{
        "query":{
            "match_all":{},
            "from": 100,
            "size": 100
        }
    }```
    This gives the 100 records starting from the 100 th document. This is very much useful in _pagination of records_

 * To specify the order use *sort*. This is equivalent to the SQL query _Order by_. The syntax is like sort: {field_name : { order: ascending/descending }}
    * Example: 
    ```{
        "query":{
            "match_all":{},
            "sort": { "rid": {"order": "desc" } }
        }
    }```

 * To specify certain fields from the documents to retrieve use *_source*. This is equivalent to _SELECT RID , NAME from TABLE_
    * Example: **The _source should be specified out of the query block.**
    ```{
        "query":{
            "match_all":{}
        }, 
        "_source": ["rid", "name"]
    }```
