# Index Operations

## Creation
The index creation is a simple and a **PUT** api has to be called with the index name and the name should be lowercased.

> PUT /{index_name}

This creates an index with the specified name.Elasticsearch by default creates **5 shards** and **1 replica shard** . But the replica cannot be used since if it's a single node. Hence the cluster health might go yellow by this time.

## Insertion of a Document
The document can be inserted using a put Api call

> PUT /twitter/tweets/1
> {
>  "name": "athavan"
> }

The above request creates a document in the twitter index and tweets mapping category.The document will have a internal id of 1 which we have specified.

## Retrieval of a Document
The document from an index can be retrived by a GET api

> GET /twitter/tweets/1

This request gets the document with internal id _id = 1 from the twitter index

## Deletion of an Index
The Index can be deleted by calling the DELETE api

> DELETE /twitter

The index twitter will be deleted and theresponse will be like 
```json
{
    "acknowledged": true
}
```
