# Basic Concepts

## Near Real Time 
Elastic has a slight latency of 1 second from indexing the document to make it searchable.

## Cluster 
 A Cluster is a collection of many **Elastic Nodes** . Nodes are different elastic servers.The cluster provides indexing and search capabilities across the nodes. The nodes are joined to a cluster by the Cluster's unique name. Every cluster has a default unique name called 'Elasticsearch'

 ## Node
 A Node is a single elastic server. A Node is a part of a cluster and it has a unique name. The Node name is useful for administration purpose. There can be multiple nodes in a single cluster. If there is only a single node running in the network, then the node by default forms a single node cluster with the name 'Elasticsearch'

## Index
 This is equivalent to a SQL table in Elastic version 6. In earlier version of Elastic, an Index is equivalent to a SQL Database. A node can have multiple indexes and each index have a unique name which must be lower in case. *Types are deprecate in Elastic 6.x*

## Document
 This is the fundamental block of elasticsearch.This is a plain JSON objects which contains some information. A Index can have as multiple documents.

## Shards and Replicas
 A Server has a physical disk constraint and a index can contain huge documents which can exceed the storage limit. Elasticsearch gives the power to sub divide an index into multiple pieces called **Shards**
 Shard is an horizontal splitting of the content volume.
 In cloud environment, there can be failures anytime and a shard may go offline. To mitigate this elasticsearch uses the **Replica Shards** which are the clone copies of index shards.

 * Why Replication?
    * High availability of data in case a shard fails. If data is not in the index shard, we can look up in replica shard. *Replica shard will be always allocted in a different Node server by Elasticsearc*
    * High Scalability since the search can be performed in all replicas and indexes parallely.
So Always Cluster the Elastic instances to get the high performance, fail proof searching capabilities.

> How many Documents a Shard can hold?
> As of now , a single shard can contain 2,147,483,519 (200 crores) documents
