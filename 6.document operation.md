# Document Operations

The documents in an index can be modified by an PUT api. If the document doesn't exist then a new document will be created.

> What is the unique key in a document which diffrentiates from other documents>
> Elastic takes care of this by introducing an **_id** property. It is unique and you can set the value while doing a PUT Request elase elastic will create a **random unique string** 

* Update a document 
```
 PUT /twitter/docs/1
 {
     "name": "athavan"
 }
```
    This updates the document with id 1 from the index twitter. If id 1 doesnt exists then it is created



* Insert a document
```
POST /twitter/docs
{
    "name": "jane"
}
```
    Elastic allows to create the document without specifying the id. So a POST request can be used for this purpose.
