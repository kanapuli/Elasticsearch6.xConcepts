# Search Query Language
 Elastic uses a json style domain specific language which is referred as **Query DSL**
 Let's see few examples

 The datas can be retrieved from elastic REST api using GET, POST. For an GET request, the queries passed as an url parameter.  For a POST request the query will be passed as a JSON body which gives us more power to express. 

 * All the queries start with a word _"query"_
    *Example: ```{
        "query": {}
    }```

 * To match all the records , use *"match_all"* .  This is an equivalent to the SQL query  _Select * from Table_
    *Example: ```{
        "query": {
            "match_all": {}
        }
    }```
