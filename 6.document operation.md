# Document Operations

The documents in an index can be modified by an PUT api. If the document doesn't exist then a new document will be created.

> What is the unique key in a document which diffrentiates from other documents>
> Elastic takes care of this by introducing an **_id** property. It is unique and you can set the value while doing a PUT Request elase elastic will create a **random unique string** 

* Update a document 
```
 PUT /twitter/docs/1
 {
     "name": "athavan"
 }
```

This updates the document with id 1 from the index twitter. If id 1 doesnt exists then it is created


* Insert a document
```
POST /twitter/docs
{
    "name": "jane"
}
```
    
Elastic allows to create the document without specifying the id. So a POST request can be used for this purpose.

* _update Api
This api is used to update the document like adding a new field to the existing document. Elastic doesn't do an partial update of document anywhere, hence it deletes the document and recreates the document with the updated information.

```
POST /twitter/docs/1
{
    "name": "rob"
}
This updates the name field of existing document with id 1

POST /twitter/docs/1
{
    "name" : "rob",
    "age"  : 51
}
This updates the name as well as adds a new field called age
```

* Delete a Document
This is simply acheived by the DELETE request

```
DELETE /twitter/docs/1
This deletes the document with id 1
```

**Deletion of multiple documents at a single time can be acheived by _DeleteByQuery_ api**
```
DELETE /twitter/docs
{
    "query":{
        "match":{
            "name": "jon"
        }
    }
}

This delete all the Documents where name matches the word *jon*
```

* Delete All documents from an index without destroying the mapping
Again this can be acheived by the DeleteByQuery api

```
DELETE /twitter/docs
{
    "query":{
        "match_all":{

        }
    }
}
This deletes all the documents from index twitter.
```
