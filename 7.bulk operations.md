# Batch Processing

 Elastic search gives the ability to update, create, delete documents in a batch using **_bulk** api
 **The batch processing does not fail if one operation fails Unlike SQL**
 Bulk Api provides response for each action so that one can find which operation has failed.

## Bulk Insert And Delete
 The following request shows how to insert multiple documents at one shot using a POST api

 ```
 POST /twitter/docs/_bulk
 {
     {"index": {"_id": 8}}
     {"region": "singapore"} 
     {"index": {"_id": 9}}
     {"region": "canada"}
 }
 ```

 The update and the delete operation can be done at the same time as follows

 ```
 POST /twitter/docs/_bulk
 {
     {"update": {"_id": 9}}
     {"doc": {"region": "France"}}
     {"delete": {"_id": 8}}
 }
```
